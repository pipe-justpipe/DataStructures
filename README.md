PROBLEM 1

Sum of Distinct Elements from Two Sets
The Sum of Distinct Elements from Two Sets program is designed to find the sum of all distinct elements that are present in either of the given sets. It provides a way to calculate the sum of unique elements from two sets without considering duplicates.

Getting Started
To use the Sum of Distinct Elements program, follow the instructions below:

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

A programming environment or code editor that supports the programming language used for the code (e.g., JavaScript).
Usage
Open a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).
Create a new file and copy the provided code into the file.
Modify the code if necessary or customize the sets (set1 and set2) with the desired elements.
Save the file with an appropriate name and the file extension associated with the programming language used (e.g., .js for JavaScript).
Run the program using the appropriate method based on the chosen programming language (e.g., executing the JavaScript file using Node.js or a web browser's console).
Example usage:

javascript
Copy code
////Example sets
const set1 = [3, 1, 7, 9];
const set2 = [2, 4, 1, 9, 3];

// Calculate sum of distinct elements
const distinctSum = findDistinctSum(set1, set2);
console.log("Distinct Sum:", distinctSum);

In the example above, the findDistinctSum function is used to calculate the sum of all distinct elements from set1 and set2. The resulting sum is then printed to the console.


PROBLEM 2

In the algorithm, vectors are represented using arrays. The dot product calculation is performed using nested loops, as it iterates through the elements of the vectors.

The algorithm demonstrates different types of parameter passing: pass by value for the dot_product procedure and pass by reference for the dot_product function.

Note that this is a pseudocode representation, so the specific syntax and implementation details may vary depending on the programming language you choose to implement it in.

Customization
You can customize the code to suit your specific needs. For example, you can modify the sets set1 and set2 by adding or removing elements. Additionally, you can incorporate the provided algorithm into a larger program or modify it to handle different data structures or requirements.

Please note that the given code is written in JavaScript. If you want to use a different programming language, you can translate the algorithm into the syntax of that language.
